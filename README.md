"# WorkTracker" 

This app allows you to easily track the amount of time spent on a given task.  Here's what you need to do.

1)  Enter a job name in the text field provided.  The app will use this, along with the current date, to automatically generate a file name.
2)  Hit the "Start" button.  The app will save the time at which you started work into a text file of the appropriate name, or create the text file if it doesn't exist yet.  It will also display the time onscreen.
3)  When you finish working, hit the "Stop" button.  The app will record the time when you stopped working to the file, along with the amount of time you spent working.  It will also display all this information to the screen.

Later on, I intend the app to be able to automatically figure out the total amount of time you spent working on this job during the current month, but it doesn't have that yet.  Also, if you turn the app off and the on again between starting and stopping a job, it gets confused.  Don't do that.  I'll add the code to fix this issue later, too.
